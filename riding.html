        <em>THE BENEFITS OF HORSEBACK RIDING</em><br>
While horseback riding is primarily a sport, it is also considered a way of life (especially for owner riders). It provides many benefits to riders, whether physical or on the morale. Indeed, this activity is usually practiced in the open air or in a riding school and in the greatest respect for nature and the horse. <br>

<em>THE PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF HORSEBACK RIDING</em><br>
Riding is a gentle sport practice. It promotes muscle development in adults, but also awakens the youngest. It improves muscle tone, balance and allows the body to gain longevity.<br>

<em>THE BENEFITS OF HORSEBACK RIDING ON MORALE</em><br>
Riding is practiced in harmony with the horse: it allows you to take time for yourself and live in the moment. It strengthens self-assurance and self-confidence, allowing riders to maintain a complicity with their mount. Riding can be practiced alone with a horse or with others. Whether in a riding club or an owner's stable, riding with friends or family creates good times and lasting memories. In cold weather in the riding arena or out in the arena, it always creates good memories.<br>

<em>THE VALUES OF HORSEBACK RIDING</em><br>
Riding is also the ideal sport to teach a child essential values such as respect for others, for the animal, for an instruction and for safety rules. The youngest learn to be persevering, attentive, patient and respectful. Riders with more experience also benefit from the values conveyed by horseback riding, especially in competition: respect for adversity, failure or success, and fair play.<br>

<em>DISCIPLINES IN HORSEBACK RIDING</em><br>
In France, there are more than 30 equestrian disciplines. Among them, there are the best known such as show jumping, dressage, cross-country, working on foot or hunter. But there are also other equestrian disciplines that are a little less widespread, such as equifeel, mountain trail, voltige, carriage driving, or trec. There are generally two main types of riding: classical riding and western riding. The first is the most widespread, although the second tends to become more and more democratized.<br>

<em>THE PASSAGE OF THE GALLOPS</em><br>
The different levels of knowledge of riders are called "galops". They gather theoretical knowledge as well as practical skills. During the vacations, improvement courses are generally offered by the equestrian centers for the passage of riding level. Beginners as well as experienced riders are welcomed to these courses where each stable offers lessons and courses, rides, pony rides, group lessons, etc.<br>
